## Assignment1
I reviewed dk3596 and tc1767's plot and forked their repository then sent the pull request to merge.

## Assignment2
I created lines with chosen slope and intercept and plot the error bars. I applied the OLS fit and WLS fit to data. And I also asked Rohun about how to create weights from the uncertainties.

## Assignment3
I investigate linear relationships between fire arm possession, homicides by fire arms, and mass shootings for different countries, considering also the country GDP.
