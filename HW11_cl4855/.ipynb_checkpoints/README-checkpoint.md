# HW11 

## Assignment 1 

First I used double loop to plot and understand how the dataset is.
Then I found the event of the time series at 126 weeks.
I found the trend by ratio change of last 10 weeks data and first 10 weeks data and plot the change of smooth and not smooth time series.
In the part 3, I figured out the slope and intercept but I can't go on :(

## Assignment 2 

I changed my figure based on the reviews from Sarah and Nathan.
