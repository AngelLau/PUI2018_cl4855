## Assignment 1: Review your classmate's Citibike project proposal
I reviewed katie's(kv871)Citibike project proposal and added some comments. 

## Assignment 2: Literature choices of statistical tests
I worked with Lav(sz2404). We searched articles together and finished the table together.

## Assignment 3: Reproduce the analysis of the Hard to Employ program in NY:
I filled in the cells that are marked "for you to do" (or similar...) and that contain missing values.

I stated the second null hypothesis (for the "Convicted of a felony after 3 years" data).

I completed Z and chi-sq tests for the "Convicted of a felony after 3 years" data.

I stated the result of the test in term the rejection of the Null in all cases (for both tests and both for the original "Ever employed in a CEO transitional job" data and the "Convicted of a felony after 3 years data").

## Assignment 4: Tests of correlation using the scipy package with citibike data.

I chose dataset from 2014 Sep and 2014 Oct. Append them to be in one dataset. Then state the Null Hypothesis, according to what I know about the test and the scipy.stats package documentation for three scipy.stats function, corresponding to the three tests. And put the caluclated statistics and the p-value in the context of null hypothesis rejection in each case.
