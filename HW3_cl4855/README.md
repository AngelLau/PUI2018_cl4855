## Assignment 2

I chose the data captial projects from NYC open data. And I found the most difficult part for this assignment was to get a dataset with both date variables and numerical variables.
And when I used the timestamp() in example instruction my date from dataset got problems. I asked Tanya and she helped me to convert the date into string so I can plot the correct date.

## Assignment 3

After I finished this assignment I found typing the buslines(like selected buses or those don't exsit) would cause key error. So I discussed this with Lav(sz2404). And she told me I could use try: except to solve this problem. 

## Assignment 4

Finished this based on the assignment 3.
