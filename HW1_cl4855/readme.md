# PUI 2018 HW1

## Assignment 1 Set up my environment:

I create a directory on my workspace on the CUSP ADRF called PUI2018. 

```mkdir PUI```

Then I use nano to create an environmental variable PUI2018 that points to that directory.

```nano ~/.bashrc```


```export PUI2018="PUI2018"```

Then create the alias pui2018

```alias pui2018="cd $PUI2018"```

I save the content and quit the nano then type:

```source ~/.bashrc``` 

```pwd```

```pui2018```

```pwd```

And the screenshot of my terminal shows this series of commands and their output:
